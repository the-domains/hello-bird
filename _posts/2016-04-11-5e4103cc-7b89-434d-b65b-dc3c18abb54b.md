For me, it's always been about ice cream + celebrating everything.

In first grade, I used to charge my classmates to write their names in cursive when we were just learning how to write.  I used the money for extra ice cream at lunch! 

I also grew up in the South, and there's a huge emphasis on beautiful entertaining.  My family has always thrown beautiful parties, and one of the first ones I can remember was a wine and cheese party at my grandparents' when I was six or seven.  There was a platter of cheese on a side table at my height, and I loved it.  It was so beautifully displayed, and my grandma had placed tiny flags in each cheese.  The flags had beautiful calligraphy on them, and my love with paper details has continued ever since.
